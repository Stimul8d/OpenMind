# OpenMind

A space for wisdom that actually matters. No empty platitudes, no Instagram philosophy, no religious preaching - just insights that help real people navigate real life.

## Why This Exists

Modern life is a weird mix of constant connection and deep isolation. We're drowning in content but starving for meaning. Mental health's going sideways, anxiety's through the roof, and most "inspirational content" is just making it worse.

This project collects ideas that actually help:
- Universal insights that work regardless of your beliefs
- Practical wisdom for dealing with modern life's existential weight
- Clear thinking from people who've wrestled with the big questions
- Zero mystical nonsense or toxic positivity

## The Technical Bits

Built with:
- React + Vite 
- Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Pages

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/OpenMind.git
cd OpenMind
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Deploy Your Own

1. Fork the repo
2. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings -> Pages -> GitHub Actions)
3. Push to main
4. Live in about 60 seconds

## Contributing Quotes

If you're adding quotes, they need to be:

1. Universal - Should resonate regardless of someone's background or beliefs
2. Actually helpful - Would this help someone dealing with anxiety, depression, or existential worry?
3. Clear - No cryptic wisdom or pseudo-profound nonsense
4. Properly sourced - We need to know where it came from and why it matters

Skip anything that:
- Requires believing in a specific faith or system
- Feels like it belongs on a motivational poster
- Oversimplifies complex human struggles
- Makes promises it can't keep

## The Plan

Keep it simple, keep it real. Might add:
- Better quote categorisation
- Smoother transitions
- More thoughtful colour schemes

But the core stays the same: surfacing ideas that actually help people think clearer and feel less alone.
