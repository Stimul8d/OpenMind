# OpenMind

Modern life's messy. Between social media noise, workplace chaos, and general uncertainty, finding genuine wisdom is harder than it should be. This project cuts through that.

## What's Different Here

We're collecting insights that actually help - proper, universal wisdom that works regardless of your background or beliefs. No mystical waffle, no Instagram philosophy, no empty platitudes.

Sources include:
- Philosophy (minus the academic faff)
- Science (the useful bits)
- Religious texts (the universal insights)
- Survival stories (because nothing cuts through like real experience)
- Engineering wisdom (people who build things)
- Historical figures (who faced proper challenges)
- Indigenous knowledge (tested over generations)
- Comedy (because sometimes jesters see clearest)

Each quote needs to:
- Actually help with real problems
- Work without believing in anything specific
- Have proper context
- Stand up to scrutiny

## The Tech

Built with:
```bash
React + Vite        # Fast builds, clean setup
Framer Motion       # Smooth transitions
Tailwind           # Styling without the mess
GitHub Pages       # Simple hosting
```

## Running It

```bash
# Get it
git clone git@github.com:your-username/OpenMind.git

# Install
cd OpenMind && npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Deploy
git push main      # That's it. GitHub Actions handles the rest
```

## Contributing

Got something genuinely useful to add? Brilliant. Check `src/data/quotes` for the category structure. Each quote needs:

- Text (obviously)
- Source (properly attributed)
- Context (why it matters)
- Tags (for filtering)

Skip anything that:
- Needs belief in a system
- Sounds good but doesn't help
- Oversimplifies human struggle
- Makes promises it can't keep

## Project Status

This is deliberately minimal. No fancy features, no complex architecture - just good ideas presented clearly. Might add categories and filtering later, but the core purpose won't change.

## Licence

MIT - do what you want with it.
